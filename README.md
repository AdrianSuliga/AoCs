# AoCs
Hello there! Since I've started professionally working with both C and C++ I've decided to take up some programming challenge and solve AoCs in both
of these languages.

# Notes
- Every exercise will be solved in both C and C++
- Redundant code will be extracted to common libraries for later reuse
- Focus is put more on learning language specific tools than achieving the best time complexity

# Progress

| 2024 | Part 1 | C | C++ | Part 2 | C | C++ |
|------|--------|---|-----|--------|---|-----|
| Day 1 | ✅ | $O(n*log(n))$ | $O(n*log(n))$ | ✅ | $O(n^2)$ | $O(n)$ |
| Day 2 | ✅ | $O(n*k)$ | $O(n*k)$ | ✅ | $O(n*k^2)$ | $O(n*k^2)$ |
| Day 3 | ✅ | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$ | ✅ | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$ | 
| Day 4 | ✅ | $O(n*m)$ | $O(n*m)$ | ✅ | $O(n*m)$ | $O(n*m)$ |
| Day 5 | ✅ | $O(n * m * k^2)$ | $O(n * m * k^2)$ | ✅ | $O(n * m * k^2)$ | $O(n * m * k^2)$ |
